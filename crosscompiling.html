    <h1> SRB2 CROSS COMPILING GUIDE</h1>
    This is a short guide for cross compiling SRB2 for multiple platforms, like for example, compiling a Windows version of SRB2 on a GNU/Linux system.
    <br>
    <br>
    Let's get straight to the point 
    <h2>Part One: Getting SRB2 Source</h2>
    <br>
    Of course, to compile SRB2, you need a copy of the source code
    <br>
    You will need Git, a source control software that SRB2's source is hosted on
    <br>
    To get Git, visit <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads"> Git's official website</a> and find the install instructions for your distro
    <br> 
    Once you did that, you can get SRB2's source with the following command
    <br>
    <br>
    <code>git clone https://git.do.srb2.org/STJr/SRB2.git</code>
    <br>
    <h2>Part Two: Obtaining Toolchains</h2>
    <br>
    To cross compile for different systems, you need different toolchains(which are collections of software that include all the nessecary programs, like compilers, linkers, etc.)
    <br>
    This guide will be showing you how to install the MinGW toolchain, which allows you to compile and cross compile for Windows systems
    <br>
    Below are the install commands for each distro
    <br>
    <br>
    Debian/Ubuntu/Linux Mint/Pop! OS
    <br>
    <br>
    <code>sudo apt install mingw-w64</code>
    <br> 
    <br>
    Arch/Arch Based
    <br>
    <br>
    <code>pacman -S mingw-w64-gcc</code>
    <br>
    <br>
    Fedora/Fedora Based
    <br>
    <br>
    <code>sudo dnf install mingw32-gcc mingw64-gcc</code>
    <br>
