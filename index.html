    <h4> <strong> What I want to do after High School</strong></h4>
    <ul>
        <li> Go to a good college, probably out of this country in this economy</li>
        <li> Study computer science there</li>
        <li> Get a job somewhere</li>
        <li> Move somewhere, anywhere </li>
    </ul>

    <h4> What I'm learning right now</h4>
Unit 1: Data
bit: A binary digit, either 0 or 1. Learn more in Binary numbers.
byte: A sequence of 8 bits. Learn more in Bytes.
roundoff: Error that results when the number of bits is not enough to represent the number with full precision (like using 3 digits to represent  as 3.14). Learn more in Number limits, overflow, and roundoff.
analog data: Values that change smoothly, rather than in discrete intervals, over time. For example, the pitch and volume of a live concert. Learn more in From analog to digital data.
lossless: Compressing data in a way that preserves all data away and allows full recovery of the original. Learn more in Data compression.
lossy: Compressing data in a way that discards some data and makes it impossible to recover the original. Learn more in Data compression.
metadata: Data about data, like descriptive information about a file or a row in a database.

Computing Device: A physical device that can run a program (e.g., computer, smartphone, smart sensor).
<br>

Computer Network: A group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending or receiving data.
<br>

Path: The series of connections between computing devices on a network, starting with the sender and ending with the receiver.
<br>

Protocol: An agreed-upon set of rules that specify how systems behave and communicate.
<br>

Fault Tolerant: A systemâ€™s ability to continue functioning even if individual components fail.
<br>

Scalability: The ability of a system to expand or contract to meet new demands.
<br>

Bandwidth: The maximum transmission capacity of a system, measured by bit rate (bits per second).
<br>

URL (Uniform Resource Locator): An easy-to-remember web address (e.g., www.example.com).
<br>

Internet Structure and Layers
Physical Network: The hardware and physical connections that carry internet signals.
<br>

Internet Protocol (IP): Assigns unique IP addresses to devices and determines how data is routed between them.
<br>

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): Ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data packets.
<br>

User Datagram Protocol (UDP): A lightweight alternative to TCP with minimal error-checking (faster but less reliable).
<br>

Packets: Small chunks of data into which larger messages are divided for transmission. Packets may arrive in order, out-of-order, or not at all.
<br>

Routers: Specialized computers that forward data across networks, choosing the fastest available path.
<br>

Domain Name System (DNS): Translates human-readable domain names (like example.com) into IP addresses.
<br>

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP): Used for transmitting and requesting web pages and media on the World Wide Web.
<br>

World Wide Web (WWW): A system of linked pages, media, and files browsable over HTTP.
<br>

Key Concepts
Message Delivery on the Internet: Messages are split into packets, which may take different paths through the network. The internet does not require a direct connection between sender and receiver.
<br>
<br>
Redundancy: Multiple pathways exist in the network so if one route fails, packets can take another.
